## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other in a zero-sum game. The generator creates fake data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. Over time, the generator improves its ability to create realistic data, while the discriminator becomes better at detecting fake data.

This notebook demonstrates the process of training a DCGAN on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- ImageIO

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib imageio
